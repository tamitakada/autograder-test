Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a dragon named Smaug. Smaug loved to hoard treasure and guarded it fiercely. Many brave knights tried to defeat Smaug, but none succeeded until a clever young girl named Lyra devised a plan. She discovered that Smaug's weakness was his vanity. She tricked him into looking at his reflection in a lake, where he was so mesmerized by his own image that he failed to notice Lyra sneaking past him to claim the treasure.
